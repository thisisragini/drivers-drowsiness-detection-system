# 🚘 Driver Drowsiness Detection using AI

An AI-powered real-time system that tracks a driver’s facial landmarks to detect signs of drowsiness and prevent accidents by triggering an instant alarm alert.

## 🧠 What It Does

This project monitors the driver’s **eye movements** and **mouth behavior** using a webcam. If it detects prolonged eye closure or yawning, it considers the driver drowsy and plays a warning alarm sound.
